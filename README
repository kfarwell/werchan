Werc is a content management system and web (anti-)framework designed to be simple to
use, simple to setup, simple to hack on, and not get on the way while allowing
users easy customization.

For more information see the official website: http://guhnoo.org/ and the Werc
website: http://werc.cat-v.org/


Installation
------------

Requirements:

* Plan 9 from User Space: http://plan9.us - Or 9base-5 or later: http://tools.suckless.org/9base
* An http server that can handle CGIs

Instructions:

Untar werc at your desired location, configure httpd to use
/path-to-your-werc-installation/bin/werc.rc as a cgi-script, it is recommended
that you make werc.rc handle all non-static files (this can be done by setting
it up as your 404 handler) and setup your virtual hosts to handle static files
by setting the document root for the domain to
/path-to-werc-installation/sites/yourdomain.com/, and create a directory for
your web site under sites/ where you can start adding content right away.

If you will want to allow updates via the web interface (eg., for wiki or
comments apps) make sure all files under sites/ are writable by the user your
cgi will run as, usually www-data, for example by doing: chown -R :www-data
sites/; chmod -R g+w sites/

If your Plan 9 from User Space installation is located somewhere else than the
standard /usr/local/plan9/ you will need to edit the first line of bin/werc.rc
and bin/prune.rc (Note that p9p is picky about where it is located, once you run
./INSTALL you should *not* move it to a different directory without running
./INSTALL again.)

For general configuration options copy etc/initrc to etc/initrc.local and
customize it as needed. Site (and directory) specific options can be set in a
sites/example.com/_werc/config file inside the site's directory. To customize
templates and included files you can store your own version of the files in
lib/ under sites/example.com/_werc/lib

For more details see the documentation section of the website:
