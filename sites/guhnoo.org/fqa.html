<p>You're probably using Abaco. Use Mothra or complain on <a href="/meta">/meta/</a> and I'll try to make it work.</p>

<p>Likely causes include my $0.25/mo server sucking. Try <a href="/donate">donating</a> or <a href="#contrib">contributing</a> an optimization patch.</p>

<h2>Does werchan respect my freedoms?</h2>
<p>Yes! It is available under the public domain as well as the MIT and ISC licenses. Get the sources <a href="http://kfarwell.org/projects/werchan/downloads/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Why aren't you preserving freedom with the GPL?</h2>
<p>werchan is based on <a href="http://werc.cat-v.org/">werc</a>, so I am using the same licensing. You can start a flamewar about it on <a href="/meta">/meta/</a> or licensing in general on <a href="/free">/free/</a>.</p>

<h2>How can I extend werchan's frontend?</h2>
